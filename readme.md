## Assignment - Styling with `CSS` 

Now let's practice some CSS! For this, you will update the index.html file and create a new CSS Stylesheet. 

Requirements:
// - Place the existing `<h1>` and `<p>` inside of a `header` element and add a background-color to that header.
// - Create a stylesheet.css file and import it into the index.html file.
// - Add a new `div` with a class name of "info". 
// - Inside that `div` add an `<h2> My name is YOUR NAME </h2>` 
// - Add a background-color and a text color of your choice to the `h2`.
// - Add an image tag `<img>` and source an image of your main mode of transportation (you car, bus, scooter, bike, feet, etc)
// - Add an `<h3>` that explains your mode of transportation. Add a background-color and a text color of your choice.

The style should look something like this (image shown has a little more CSS - feel free to try some new things!)
